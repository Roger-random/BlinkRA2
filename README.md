# PIC16F18345 pulses LED connected to pin RA2 via PWM module

This is a project created in Microchip Technology's MPLAB X IDE. The primary purpose is to verify MPLAB X plays nice with GitHub. 

The target chip is a PIC16F18345

The commit history should show:

1. Project initialized with a blank project + .gitignore file.
2. Populated with boilerplate generated code from the MCC tool.
3. Made the fewest edits necessary to arrive at the minimal blink.
4. Add the fancier PWM and Timer modules for the pulsation.
